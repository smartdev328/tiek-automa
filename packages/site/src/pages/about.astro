    ProAutoma API monitoring is not just monitoring software. It is also Test software to help validate APIs by
    asserting on various conditions including status codes, time taken, and shape of the response. It does so in
    parallel from global data centers to ensure global reach and availability, and be closer to your customers. With JS
    scripting, it can go further than the no-code platform but only as needed.
